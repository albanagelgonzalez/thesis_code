# Bachelor Thesis Code

The respository holds all the code generated during the time of the bachelor's thesis. 

It is structured as follows:

- The **Detaxizer Notebook** is inside of the `Detaxizer_notebook/` directory, together with the necessary environments and a README.md explanation.
- The code for the analysis part is in the directory `analysis_code/` and has all the files for the sequencing inspection, alpha- and beta-diversity, as well as the analysis for the abundance at the genus level.
